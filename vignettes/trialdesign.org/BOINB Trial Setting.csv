"Parameters","Description"
"numdose","Number of doses"

"target","Target toxicity probability"
"bound","Use the default alternatives to minimize decision error"
"lambda1","Escalation boundary (lambda1)"
"lambda2","De-escalation boundary (lambda2)"
"cohortsize","Cohort size"
"ncohort","Number of cohort"
"n.earlystop","Stop trial if the number of patients assigned to single dose reaches this number and the decision is to stay. If this option is disabled in Shiny app, this value is the maximum sample size."
"titration","Perform accelerated titration?"
"titration.cap","(used only when titration is Yes) Cap the titration up to dose level:"
"bound.modify.1","Modify the decision from 'de-escalate' to 'stay' when 1 out of 3 patients experienced DLT, optional for target in (0.25, 0.279)"
"bound.modify.2","Modify the decision from 'stay' to 'de-escalate'  when 2 out of 6 patients experienced DLT, optional for target in (0.28, 0.33)"
"cutoffeli","Probability cutoff for overdose control (pE)"
"extrasafe","Impose a more stringent safety stopping rule on the lowest dose"
"offset","Delta value when a more strigent safety stopping rule on the lowest dose is imposed"
"boundMTD","Make sure the selectd MTD has a isotonic estimate of DLT probability less than de-escalation boundary"
